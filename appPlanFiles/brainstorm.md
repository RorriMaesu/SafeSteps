Ren's Boundaries App-

Our idea is to create an app which allows children to explore their neighborhood boundaries set by their parents, and the app should have GPS tracking and a map, so the child is notified if they go beyond the boundaries set by their parent. 

The parents can view the map to see where the child is, and the child can open the map on their device if they want to see the boundaries. The parents draw on the map to set the boundaries, the red line will indicate the bounds, if they go beyond the bounds the parents and the child will get notified. 

We also want to ensure they stay on the sidewalks and have features to notify when they are crossing the street, and or if they are in the street for too long. 

we want it to notify the children with max volume notifications using Text to Speech to directly to talk to the children when they are nearing their boundaries, and for all other notifications for clear understanding. 

We also want the ability to turn it off from the parents device if they wish, also we want it to be smart, so if it detects that the child is at home, or with their parent; then it should disable notifications. 

We want to make it so the parents can change the boundaries at will easily. and we want to ensure it has precise accuracy so it automatically snaps their boundary lines to the nearest sidewalks with special manual adjust mode too for special cases. 

We also want to have a feature where if the child is with the parent and beyond their boundaries already set, then if the parent and child become separated, like at a festival or event for example, then it should automatically create boundary limits and notifications by default and if the child gets too far from the parent, then it should notify both the parent and child devices. 



After we finish the phone app and it is fully working; then we will consider building special devices worn by the children so they do not need a cell phone. They could talk to their parents or 911 through the device.
